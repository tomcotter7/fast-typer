# Bots

This repository is a collection of bots I plan on creating for automating tasks. There currently exists two bots:
  - fast-typer
  - automated-audio-books

### Fast Typer

A simple program to test my skills with selenium. The program performs a typing speed test. It was made to annoy my friend who kept beating me in a typing speed challenge.

### Automated Audio Books

A program to turn pdfs into .mp3 audio books using Google's TTS Cloud API.
